# Introduction_to_AI_with_Blueprints
I follow the course [Introduction to AI with Blueprints](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/learning/courses/67R/introduction-to-ai-with-blueprints/mX27/introduction-to-ai-with-blueprints). This course is based on Unreal Engine 4(UE4) but I do it in UE5.
This course covers navigation, AI perception, behavior trees, and Environment Query System(EQS).
